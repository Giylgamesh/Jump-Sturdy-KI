# Jump-Sturdy
University Symbolic AI Project

This repository houses the code for a symbolic AI project developed by three Bachelor students at Technische Universität Berlin for the "Symbolische Künstliche Intelligenz" (Symbolic Artificial Intelligence) project.

The project focuses on building an AI agent to play the game "Jump Sturdy".

We welcome contributions and discussions!

### Key Features:
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: We will utilize alpha-beta pruning for efficient decision making within the game tree.
- State Representation: We will design a suitable representation of the game state.
- Heuristic-based Action Selection: The AI will use a heuristic-based system to choose the best action based on the game state and game logic.

### Game Rules:
Jump Sturdy is a 2 players game played on an 8x8 board with corners removed. Each player starts with twelve pieces positioned as below.

Single pieces move sideways or forward one space and capture forward diagonally.

Stacks of two move and capture as a chess knight but only the top piece moves.

A capture or move can be onto an empty space or a friendly piece.

The goal is to reach the opponent’s home row first. Alternatively, capturing all the opponent's men or blocking an opponent completely also constitutes a win.
